Lists
– To access the first and last element of a list you use: .last and .first


void main() {
   List<String> drinks = ["water", "juice", "milk", "coke"];
   print("First element of the List is: ${drinks.first}");
   print("Last element of the List is: ${drinks.last}");
}


– Check if the list is empty or not:
void main() {
   List<String> drinks = ["water", "juice", "milk", "coke"];
   List<int>  ages = [];
   print("Is drinks Empty: "+drinks.isEmpty.toString());
   print("Is drinks not Empty: "+drinks.isNotEmpty.toString());
   print("Is ages Empty: "+ages.isEmpty.toString());
   print("Is ages not Empty: "+ages.isNotEmpty.toString());
